    "\n",
    "## so when two keys create them same address, its a collision and no single solution for this.\n",
    "### when you have a key with an already used address, putting it at an open address is called Open-addressing. Using a linear search to find this open address is called **Linear Probing**. However, this makes it hard to find items also, invloving a linear search if it's not at the calculated address.\n",
    "### The more open addresses in the array, the less likely a colission. This percentage of openess is called the **Load Factor**. As long as it's low, Open addressing + linear probing should work well.\n",
    "### $Number of Entries / Number of Buckets$ The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense of how \"full\" a hash table is. For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehash—as the load factor approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is. On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to 1 (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Another solution is called chaining or closed addressing.\n",
    "### Every repeat becomes the next element in a linked-list headed by the first element with that address. To search this, just calculate the address and use a standard linked list traversal. If the load factor is low, it may be more effiecient to just use linear probing, as ther well be very few collisisions\n",
    "## Some other collision resolution ideas:\n",
    "* ### plus three rehash: probe multiples of three forward in the search for openess\n",
    "* ### quadratic probing: search at the (failed attempts)^2 address for openess\n",
    "* ### double hasheing: apply a second hash function to the collided keys\n",
